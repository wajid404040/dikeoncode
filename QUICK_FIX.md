# 🚨 **QUICK FIX: Get Emotions Working in 2 Minutes!**

## ❌ **The Problem:**

Your emotional monitoring is not working because the Hume AI API key is missing!

## ✅ **The Solution:**

Create a `.env.local` file with your Hume AI API key.

## 🚀 **Step-by-Step Fix:**

### 1. **Get Your Hume AI API Key**

- Go to [Hume AI Console](https://console.hume.ai/)
- Sign in to your account
- Copy your API key from the dashboard

### 2. **Create Environment File**

In the `fiber talking avatar` folder, create a new file called `.env.local`:

```bash
# Create this file: fiber talking avatar/.env.local
HUME_API_KEY="your_actual_api_key_here"
```

**Example:**

```bash
HUME_API_KEY="mH1XbhVFxV0DCJL6QF64cDzKeX3LjXB77mTT6CdUK7PhrPwM"
```

### 3. **Restart Your App**

- Stop the current app (Ctrl+C)
- Run `npm run dev` again
- Refresh your browser

### 4. **Test the Connection**

- Click "Monitoring ON" button
- Click the new "Test API" button (green button)
- You should see: "✅ API Key found!"

## 🔍 **How to Verify It's Working:**

1. **Check Console (F12):** Look for these messages:

   ```

   ✅ API key retrieved successfully
   ✅ Connected to Hume AI for emotion monitoring
   🚀 Starting emotion monitoring...
   📸 Capturing frame...
   📤 Sending to Hume AI, data size: [number]
   ```

2. **Check Status Bar:** Should show "AI connected - monitoring emotions..."

3. **Make Faces:** Try smiling, frowning, looking sad

4. **Watch for Emotions:** They should appear in real-time!
